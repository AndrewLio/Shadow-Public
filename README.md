# Shadow - Client

Client: 1.20.71
IDE: visual studio ._.

I have made the mistake of pasting and copying aeolus visuals as "Draco" told me to and he gave me 30$ for me to code this shit pasted code and then also pasted the name and named it " "Nigger Client" Aeolus V2 SKID??? NO WAY!!" " and I hate that. He also kept asking for the newer version everytime or he will leak the source code so I keep sending him its the time I stop and leak/release this by my own and not some lowlife paster I hated pasting this So I am going to recode it without pasting visuals/codes Thanks to those people who made me relize that draco isn't trusted
